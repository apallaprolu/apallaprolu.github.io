I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/).

My research focuses on wireless sensing and perception systems, combining physics-aware signal processing and large-scale experimental validation. I build end-to-end RF sensing pipelines using commodity WiFi and mmWave hardware, develop automated simulation and verification workflows, and evaluate system performance across real-world deployments.

Previously, I worked at Qualcomm as a VLSI CAD Engineer on advanced-node SoC sign-off and automation. I hold an M.S. in Physics and a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan.

Things that keep me busy:
- Near Field Wireless Imaging
- Exchange Traded Funds
- 3D Powder Printers

Things that used to keep me busy:
- VLSI Design, Billion-Net Mesh IC Signoff
- Fat Tailed Probability Distributions
- Topological Insulators, my first paper was [published](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.085405) in Phys. Rev. B, check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08354.pdf).

I used to enjoy photography with my DSLR but then I realized the superficiality of harnessing a complex camera and decided to do the best I could simply with my phone instead. I strongly feel the composition of the capture decides your skill and also I lost my DSLR when we were shifting houses. More of this [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/105114536@N07/).
