## Welcome!

I'm an electrical engineering graduate student at UC Santa Barbara. I report to [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/) who runs the wireless sensing and human-computer interaction based robotics laboratory. 

I worked for Qualcomm from July 2017 to September 2019, and worked towards my Masters in Physics and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan from August 2012 to June 2017. You can check [this](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apallapr/) for more details. Make sure you send me a connection request as well!

Things that keep me busy:
- Random crowd simulation for EM field analysis.
- High-volatility-asset management using ensemble learning for trend recognition.
- Pareto equilibria in MIMO communication systems.
- Perceptrons, the Girard-Reynolds Type System, Ito Calculus, yada yada.

Things that used to keep me busy:
- VLSI Design, Billion-Net Mesh IC Signoff
- Topological Insulators, my first paper was [published](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.085405) in Phys. Rev. B, check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08354.pdf).

I used to enjoy photography with my DSLR but then I realized the superficiality of a complex camera and decided to do my best with my phone since the composition decides your skill (also mainly because I lost my DSLR when we were shifting houses).
