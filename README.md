I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, advised by [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/).

My research focuses on wireless sensing and perception systems, combining physics-aware signal processing and large-scale experimental validation. I build end-to-end RF sensing pipelines using commodity WiFi and mmWave hardware, develop automated simulation and verification workflows, and evaluate system performance across real-world deployments.

Previously, I worked at Qualcomm as a VLSI CAD Engineer on advanced-node SoC sign-off and automation. I hold an M.S. in Physics and a B.E. in Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan.

## Selected Research & Projects

### mmWave Sensing and Crowd Analytics
I developed inference methods for mmWave sensing systems operating under partial observability caused by human occlusions. Specifically, I showed that blockage of mmWave signals by individuals in a crowd is not a limitation, but a useful signal that can be leveraged to infer occupancy and extract latent analytics.

I further designed and deployed a system that utilizes the TI AWR2243BOOST commodity mmWave MIMO radar to unravel dominant crowd flow patterns by constructing flow fields from sparse point clouds.

### WiFi Imaging via Diffraction-Based RF Modeling
I investigated diffraction-dominated RF propagation as a sensing primitive, focusing on how edges encode geometric information that is not captured by specular reflection models. This work demonstrates that edge diffraction enables imaging of extended objects using commodity WiFi transceivers, including through-wall scenarios.

I experimentally characterized Keller cones at 5 GHz and showed that edge-based imaging remains reliable even when sharp geometric features are not visually apparent.

This line of work has been validated across several real-world experiments and has appeared in [ACM MobiCom 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3495243.3514261), [IEEE RadarConf](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10538467), and [IEEE JSTEAP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=11173623).

### RF Field Programming and Edge-Based Metasurfaces

Building on diffraction-aware modeling, I explored how engineered edges can be used to program RF fields in space. I proposed passive edge-lattice metasurfaces that enable multi-point RF focusing without active elements or phase shifters.

The approach was validated experimentally using low-cost, fully passive structures, achieving simultaneous multi-focal field formation with measurable gain improvements. This work connects physical-layer modeling with forward design of RF environments.

This research resulted in a [U.S. patent application](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250123391A1/en) and a publication at [ACM MobiCom 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3570361.3613266).

### Collaborative and System-Level Wireless Sensing
Across these projects, I have emphasized system-level design: integrating sensing hardware, signal processing pipelines, simulation workflows, and experimental validation. I have built automated EM simulation pipelines (Ansys HFSS, REMCOM Wireless InSite) to support large parametric sweeps and reproducible evaluation.

My work reflects a broader interest in sensing systems that operate under real-world variability, where assumptions routinely break and robustness must be established through verification and field testing.
