## Welcome!

I'm an electrical engineering graduate student at UC Santa Barbara. I report to [Prof. Yasamin Mostofi](https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~ymostofi/) who runs the wireless sensing and human-computer interaction based robotics laboratory. 

I worked for Qualcomm from July 2017 to September 2019, and worked towards my Masters in Physics and Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from BITS Pilani, Rajasthan from August 2012 to June 2017. You can check [this](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apallapr/) for more details. Make sure you send me a connection request as well!

Things that keep me busy:
- Metamaterials and Programmable Radio Environments
- Near Field Wireless Imaging
- Exchange Traded Funds
- 3D Powder Printers

Things that used to keep me busy:
- VLSI Design, Billion-Net Mesh IC Signoff
- Fat Tailed Probability Distributions
- Topological Insulators, my first paper was [published](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.085405) in Phys. Rev. B, check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08354.pdf).

I used to enjoy photography with my DSLR but then I realized the superficiality of harnessing a complex camera and decided to do the best I could simply with my phone instead. I strongly feel the composition of the capture decides your skill and also I lost my DSLR when we were shifting houses. More of this [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/105114536@N07/).
